# Weatherly-App

# React Weather 
A simple weather app built with React

# Heroku Live :
https://weatherly-react-app-a.herokuapp.com/

# Development stack 
The flow was enabled to catch typing errors in React JavaScript code 
I used Nuclide and Visual Studio Code on OSX, both have great support for React app development 
I used git for version control and stored progress on GitHub. 
Currently only tested on a Web app

# APIs 
Weather data is retrieved from http://openweathermap.org/ You can see examples of API data in react-weather/api

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start 
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test 
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build 
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
